# Phishing-Detector

Phishing is a massive problem globally, affecting millions of people every year. According to recent statistics, phishing attacks have increased by over 50% in the past year alone. In fact, it's estimated that nearly 1 in every 100 emails sent is a phishing attempt. This means that billions of phishing emails are sent out annually, targeting individuals, businesses, and organizations alike. Moreover, phishing attacks are responsible for over 80% of reported security incidents, making it the most common form of cyber threat

This predictive model helps people stay safer online by quickly spotting fake websites trying to steal their information, like passwords or credit card numbers. Imagine it like a super-smart guard that watches out for you while you're browsing the web. It makes things easier because instead of worrying about whether a website is trustworthy or not, the model does the hard work for you. So, you can surf the web with more peace of mind, knowing that this guard is on duty, keeping you safe from online scams and frauds.

The future scope of the model entails enhancements in machine learning techniques, multi-language support, and cross-platform integration to bolster its efficacy in detecting phishing attacks. Integrating the model into a user-friendly website interface would allow individuals to effortlessly check the legitimacy of URLs, providing clear feedback on the phishing risk associated with each entered URL. Additionally, offering an API for developers and crowdsourced feedback mechanisms would further refine the model's performance over time, while educational resources alongside the URL checking feature would empower users to better protect themselves against online threats.
